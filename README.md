## How does it work
For anyone, who is confused about the term swarm inteligence: it does not involve hooking up your brain with some suspiciously looking metal objects.

It actually only involes you committing code to [github.com/hhu-swarm](https://github.com/hhu-swarm) while taking advantage of preexisting knowledge there.

Every time you solve an equiasion or puzzle or any other computationally effortfull task (CET), feel free to write it up in LaTeX. Whenever youre satisfied with the results, classify your kind of knowledge. Pick one of the preexisting repositories on [github.com/hhu-swarm](https://github.com/hhu-swarm) and clone it. Integrate your computational product and push it back to github. That way others gain from your CET just as you might gain from others CETs.

## Knowledge acquisition
Knowledge is obtained, whenever a human beeing learns a new thing. This knowledge might be of many different kinds like:
- practical (e.g. how to code)
- theoretical (how do binary trees work)
- methodically (how to read a book effectively)

Imagine a place, where humans contribute to a central repository of knowledge that is publicly available? Imagine beeing part of a community of humans, who build this central repository from scratch. Imagine learning how to use several technologies in the process.

## Justification

Someone might say: **How is this better than wikipedia**?
Well, there are several advantages:
- More approachable: content is directly related to your own university.
- More extracted knowledge: Many wikipedia articles give a summary on a certain toppic and link more details in the sources section. Those sources are usually on a similar depth as universities teach. Unfortunately looking into a book and extracting knowledge from it is time consuming. Maintaining that extracted knowledge directly on github in a LaTeX representation is way more approchable in comparison.
- Less locked down: Creating a change on a certain wikipedia article is a very time consuming process, which involes multiple other members of the wikipedia community to review your change. This might take several days at least. Creating a pull request on github is way more sensible, as other students should know the topic just as well as you do and are also currently involved in the same process of learning the exact same topic.
- Less limited: Wikipedia just isn`t complete. Especially certain computer science topics lack in depth. Universities just teach way more details, than common folk will ever find on wikipedia.
- More encouraging: Publishing a certain wikipedia change won`t have any effect on fellow students. This will not be the case, if you publish your CET directly to [github.com/hhu-swarm](https://github.com/hhu-swarm), as they are more related to it in comparison. This might encourage them way more to participate on this platform for swarm intelligence.
